# Sozie Android Assessment

Hello, you've been invited to the next round of the Sozie senior android developer interview. This step features a take home assessment in which you will be building the browse page component of the Sozie application. 

In case you haven't already, remember to take a look at the Sozie iOS documentation here! <<insert_link_here>>

The main landing page of the current Sozie application features 4 tabs, browse, wish list, requests, and help.



If you have any questions/concerns while taking the assessment, don't hesitate to reach out at muneebazam45@gmail.com.
